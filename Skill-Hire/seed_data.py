Run once to populate the workers table with sample data, so the API has
something to log in with and test against while you build the real
worker-onboarding flow.

Every seeded worker gets the SAME demo password so you can log into the
worker portal (/worker) with any of their phone numbers immediately:

    password: kaamgar123

Usage:  python seed_data.py
